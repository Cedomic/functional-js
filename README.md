# Functional JS/TS

This repository is a place where I try to write down important functional programming concepts with examples and explanations.

The code is written in `TypeScript`, so I am able to define some types for, e.g. `algebraic structures` like `Functors`, `Applicative Functors`, `Monads`, etc...

## Why am I doing this?

Currently I am trying to learn functional programming with Haskell & PureScript. After some time I found that learning all those concepts at once in a new language is kinda hard. So I decided to take those functional programming concepts like function composition, Functors, Applicative Functors, Monads, etc. and try to implement them in a language I know very well, JavaScript/TypeScript. by doing this I hope to understand those concepts better.

Maybe you can find something interesting too!

## Usage

In order to run the files you need Node.js on your machine.

    $ git clone https://github.com/Cedomic/functional-js.git
    $ cd functional-js
    $ npm i
    $ tsc

Now you can execute single files with:

    node dist/{filename}.js
